## Release Notes

### Migration Guide from v1.1.x to v1.2.x

#### Configuration Changes

**Old Configuration (v1.1.x):**

```cpp
oranHelper->SetLogicModule("ns3::OranLmLte2LteDistanceHandover");
```

**New Configuration (v1.2.x):**

```cpp
oranHelper->SetDefaultLogicModule("ns3::OranLmLte2LteDistanceHandover");
```

#### API Changes

**Deprecated Methods:**

- `OranHelper::SetLogicModule()` - Use `SetDefaultLogicModule()` instead
- `OranDataRepository::GetAllReports()` - Use `GetReports()` with filters

**New Methods:**

- `OranHelper::AddLogicModule()` - For additional logic modules
- `OranNearRtRic::GetPerformanceMonitor()` - Access performance metrics
- `OranDataRepository::ExecuteQuery()` - Direct SQL query execution

#### Database Schema Updates

The database schema has been updated to support new features:

```sql
-- New tables in v1.2.x
CREATE TABLE performance_metrics (
    timestamp REAL,
    component TEXT,
    metric_name TEXT,
    metric_value REAL
);

CREATE TABLE logic_module_executions (
    execution_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    lm_name TEXT,
    start_time REAL,
    end_time REAL,
    input_report_count INTEGER,
    output_command_count INTEGER
);
```

### Known Issues

#### v1.2.0

- PyTorch integration requires manual library installation
- ONNX models with custom operators not fully supported
- Performance monitoring may impact simulation speed in debug builds

#### v1.1.0

- Database file locking issues on some NFS filesystems
- Memory usage grows with very long simulations (>24 hours simulated time)
- Some LTE traces may not trigger properly in edge cases

#### v1.0.0

- Limited to LTE scenarios (5G support planned for future releases)
- Single RIC deployment only (federated RIC support planned)
- Basic conflict mitigation (advanced algorithms planned)

### Security Considerations

#### Database Security

- SQLite databases are created with restrictive permissions (600)
- No network access to database (local file only)
- SQL injection protection through prepared statements

#### Memory Safety

- Smart pointer usage eliminates most memory leaks
- Bounds checking in array access
- Resource cleanup in destructors

#### Input Validation

- All user inputs validated before processing
- Configuration parameters checked for valid ranges
- Report data sanitized before storage
